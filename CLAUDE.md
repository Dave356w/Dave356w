# Working standards — Dave356w/Dave356w

MLB matchup-leans site. `build_site.py` renders daily cards to `public/`,
`grade_leans.py` grades pending rows against StatsAPI linescores,
`market_backfill.py` joins DK open/close via ESPN. GitHub Actions builds on a
pregame trigger (`schedule_gate.py`) and commits `data/` back to the repo.

Read `MATCHUP_SITE.md` for the model. Read this first for how to work here.

## Method

- **Evidence before conclusions.** Claims about this codebase get verified
  against the ledger or the source, not recalled. If you assert a record, a
  distribution, or a behaviour, run it first and paste the number.
- **Verify, don't recall.** Do not describe what a function does from its name
  or its docstring. Both have been wrong in this repo. Read the body.
- **Benchmark proposed fixes before recommending them.** A change that sounds
  principled can be worse than what it replaces. Compare candidates on the
  metric the fix is supposed to improve, across enough seeds to see variance,
  and report the loser honestly — including when the loser is your own proposal.
- **Subtractive.** Prefer deleting a branch to adding one. A fix that removes a
  special case beats a fix that adds a tier. If a change grows the code, say why
  the simpler version fails.
- **No sycophancy.** Do not open with praise. Lead with the finding. If a
  request rests on a wrong premise, say so before answering it.

## Model versioning — two namespaces, do not conflate

`MODEL_TAG` stamps every ledger row with its lineage. Bump it on any change to
prediction math. Two separate tag families gate two different questions:

- `RECORD_TAGS` — may these rows share a win-loss line? Prediction-math
  compatibility. Governs `_record_grades()` and the weight fit.
- `SCALE_TAGS` — do these rows measure `xw_net` on the same scale? Units
  compatibility. Governs `lean_strength_scale()` only.

These are different equivalence relations and they do disagree. The authority is
`_RECORD_FAMILIES` / `_SCALE_FAMILIES` in `build_site.py` (records mirrored in
`grade_leans.py`) — not this table, which is a reading aid. Current model is
**v10**.

| tag | what changed | record family | scale family |
|---|---|---|---|
| v2 | baseline | 2 | 2 |
| v3 | pregame lock only, math identical to v2 | 2+3 | 3 |
| v4 | slot-PA lineup weighting | 4 | 4 |
| v5 | empirical-Bayes xwOBA shrinkage (halved the scale, median `\|xw_net\|` .036 → .018) | 5 | 5+6 |
| v6 | expected-IP starter/bullpen blend; inherits v5 shrinkage | 6 | 5+6 |
| v7 | centre-matched shrinkage moments; full precision; zero = abstention | 7 | 7 |
| v8 | fixed `K=100` shrinkage, widening the delta distribution | 8 | 8+9+10 |
| v9 | starter/bullpen phases split; handedness applies to starter innings only | 9+10 | 8+9+10 |
| v10 | phases weighted by PA share (measured BF/IP) not innings share | 9+10 | 8+9+10 |

Two entries earn their keep as precedent. **v6 shares v5's units but not its
record line** — a new prediction family can inherit a scale. **v10 shares both
of v9's** — the PA-share reweight is a convex combination of the same two
phases, so units are untouched, and it flips 0 of 14 leans on measured rates,
so the win-loss line is shared rather than reset for the eighth time in a month.
A bump does not automatically mean isolation; argue it.

Known latent gap: v3's scale family is `(3,)` because `_SCALE_FAMILIES` has no
v3 entry, though v3's math is identical to v2 and the two must share units.
Inert — `SCALE_TAGS` only ever derives from the *current* tag — so it is
recorded, not patched.

When you bump `MODEL_TAG`, decide both questions explicitly in the PR body.
Silence defaults to a new record family and inherited units — which is wrong
about half the time. And when you bump it, grep for the tag: it must live in
exactly one place per module. See the workflow-pin anti-pattern below.

Display-only changes do not bump `MODEL_TAG`. Card layout, copy, CSS, legend
text: no bump. Anything that moves a lean, a delta, or a grade: bump.

## Anti-patterns with instances in this repo

Each entry names a real commit in this repo. Resolved ones are kept as
precedent — they are how the fix is known to look.

**Live — not yet fixed**

- **One value, three homes.** `.github/workflows/build.yml` pinned `MODEL_TAG`,
  `RECORD_TAGS`, and `SCALE_TAGS` job-level while both modules also defaulted
  them. The v10 commit bumped the modules and missed the workflow; the env wins,
  so CI ran v10's PA-share weighting and stamped every row `v9`. The 14 rows
  built 2026-07-28 carry v10 math under a v9 tag and are immutable. Detectable
  only because they hold a non-null `sp_bf_per_ip`, which no genuine v9 row has.
  A config value that duplicates a code default will drift; delete the copy
  rather than syncing it.
- **Constants frozen from data.** `LEAN_STRENGTH_FALLBACK` was a literal copy of
  the pooled p33/p80 at the time it was written, and stayed there through two
  model versions that changed the distribution underneath it. It has since been
  re-derived for the v8/v9/v10 scale, but it is still a literal and will go
  stale again on the next scale family. If a constant was read off the ledger,
  comment where it came from and what would invalidate it.

**Resolved — keep as precedent**

- **Deleting controls as clutter.** The walk-forward Pythagorean control arm was
  added, then removed in a UI declutter three commits later, leaving the
  always-home F5 baseline in `ledger_report.txt` as the only control anywhere —
  and none at all on the public page, which published `200-151 (.570)` with
  nothing to read it against. Fixed by `_baseline_controls()`: always-home and
  always-chalk, scored on the identical graded rows, muted tiles in the same
  strip as the record. They are what makes the headline a result — the model's
  .570 against .504 always-home and .563 always-chalk. Controls establish
  whether the model beats a trivial baseline; if one is visually noisy, mute it
  or move it to the ledger as a column — do not delete it.

- **Threshold cliffs.** Two instances, same shape. The old
  `use = fam if len(fam) >= 60 else pooled` scale selector switched
  discontinuously and mixed incompatible units; `SCALE_TAGS` removed that
  branch. Then `lean_strength_scale()` was found returning `None` below
  `LEAN_STRENGTH_MIN = 30`, so the cutoffs swapped the frozen
  `LEAN_STRENGTH_FALLBACK` for the pool's own p33/p80 in one step — worth up to
  0.0096 on p80, relabelling every game in the crossed band with no change to
  any lean. Fixed by deleting the gate and shrinking the observed quantiles
  toward the prior by pool size, `c = (n·c_obs + K·c_prior)/(n + K)` — the
  empirical-Bayes form already used for xwOBA, applied to a quantile. The
  prior stops being a branch and becomes the `n = 0` limit of one expression.
  **The general lesson:** when a selector has a hard `>= N`, the fix is usually
  not a better `N` — it is to make `N` a weight so nothing switches. And pick
  the weight by benchmark: the obvious `K = 30` (the old gate reinterpreted)
  measured *worse than the gate* on label stability; `K = 100` cut the worst
  single-row step 4.4× and landed nearer the population quantile.
- **Public claims the data can't support.** `grades.html` asserted every row
  locked before first pitch while `lock_status` was null on the pre-v3 rows.
  Fixed by `_lock_provenance()`, which now states the split instead of the
  whole — currently "168 of 317 rows carry a pregame lock timestamp; 149 legacy
  rows predate that instrumentation." Report provenance, don't assert coverage.
  The same entry recurred one level down: `_lock_provenance()` counted the
  unverified remainder *by subtraction* and the page labelled all of it
  "legacy rows predate that instrumentation", which would have described a
  `late_snapshot` row — instrumented and failed — as uninstrumented. Zero such
  rows exist today, so it was a claim waiting to go wrong rather than a live
  one. Now each outcome is counted from its own label. A count you derived by
  subtracting cannot carry a name you did not measure.
- **Internal and public artifacts disagreeing.** `data/ledger_report.txt` once
  said the current family had no graded games while the site published a pooled
  record. Both now render from the same ledger through
  `RECORD_TAGS` — the report shows the current family plus immutable per-family
  history, the site shows the pooled headline. When you change one, change the
  other or state in the PR why they should differ.

## No-lookahead

`.savant_cache/` is gitignored and keyed by slate date. Leaderboard state as of
a past game is not recoverable, so historical rows cannot be re-derived from
today's Savant pull — that is lookahead, not backfill. Pending rows never
receive closing lines (`run_market_update.py` invariant). Do not relax either.

## Before opening a PR

```
python validate_data_files.py     # CSV conflict markers — has failed twice in prod
python -m pytest tests/ -q        # 246 tests; CI does NOT run these yet
```

CI has no test step and `requirements.txt` has no pytest. Until that is fixed,
running the suite locally is the only gate. If you touch `build_site.py`,
`grade_leans.py`, or `market_backfill.py`, run both commands and paste the
output in the PR.

Do not commit `data/` by hand — the Actions bot owns it. Do not commit
`public/`.

## Load-bearing, change with care

- `concurrency: site-build` with `cancel-in-progress: false` — serializes
  ledger commits. Removing it interleaves writes.
- Build exits non-zero without writing `index.html` on fetch failure, so the
  last good page stays live. Preserve that ordering.
- `timeout-minutes` on both jobs — an upstream API hang otherwise burns minutes.
- Score verification in `attach_market` — it correctly rejected the All-Star
  Game join. Do not loosen to raise the match rate.
