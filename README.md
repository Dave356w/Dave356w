👋 Hi, I’m @Dave356w

👀 I’m interested in Python, web scraping, and sports prediction models. I like the idea of extracting and analyzing data to predict sports outcomes.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about advanced Python for web scraping like Scrapy and Beautiful Soup, as well as diving deeper into machine learning techniques for sports prediction.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that involve web scraping and sports prediction models. I'm particularly interested in projects that aim create new statistic calculations.
